## My resume page

https://theflucs.github.io/my_resume/

Base of this project was the GitHub Learning Lab Repository for Managing Merge Conflicts.

I then modified it according to my needs.

This course is using the :sparkles: open source project [resume-template](https://github.com/jglovier/resume-template).
